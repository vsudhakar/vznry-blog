excerpt: Steve Jobs famously said that thing about how styluses are terrible, and then every device became electronic finger food. Enter Casper, a library for touch based Android control and automation via the ADB shell. Casper provides both a scaffold for basic app interactions in Android as well as a feature based detection system to determine appropriate actions on unfamiliar app screens. Casper is, however, very much still a work in progress. Check out the code on GitHub.
