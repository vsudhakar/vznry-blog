The GitHub pages repos have been created, DNS is successfully set up and I have my dev environment perfectly created.

The AWS lambda functions, S3 Buckets, CDN and Slack channel have all been plumbed together in an intricate machine to finally orchestrate .... what?

Obviously, this isn't my first attempt at a blog (it's 2020 after all, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who hasn't been through 12 of these already). But what's changed?

Well, I'd like to think a few things.

1. This is now a *known website* (yikes, I know) and it gives me some motivation to post interesting updates to share with friends and family at the very least.
2. Quarantine. I'm not going to go as far as to say I have a lot of time on my hands, but I do spend a decent chunk of it indoors and blogging seems like a good way to reflect on my hobbies and interests.
3. The need to document my progress. This one seems a bit vague, but I will likely devote most of this blog to photography and retrospectives are good to understand what I need to improve on next.

Anyways, stay tuned for the first non hello world post coming shortly!
