            <p>I worked at a few different places over the last year or so.</p>

                    Backend stuff was in Django, frontend client apps were in React Native. I have AWS horror stories here too, maybe not comparable to Bluemix though.

            <div id="publishing">

                        I was all over the place here. I mostly built a machine learning based text summarization / SEO extraction tool. Used TensorFlow and Python extensively for that. On the other side, I wrote a webscraper + load testing tool using Go*. I also did a lot of random cloud management in Heroku for testing, <b>IBM Bluemix**</b> for production.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Also worked for some consulting projects involving AI driven customer service. Wrote chatbot backends using <a href="https://github.com/botmasterai/botmaster">Botmaster</a> to abstract away interaction layers, some NoSQL dbs for state management (oh dear...), and hastily thrown together UI in React. <i>If you are interested in tech consulting oh boy do I have some war stories...</i>
                    </p>

                    <b>*Go</b>
                    <p>Yep, never used it before, learned it in a day. Like I said, tech stacks aren't important and do NOT take your formal CS education for granted.</p>

                    <b>**IBM Bluemix</b>
                    <p>Holy cow I have some stories.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="amazon">
                <h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon - Alexa Devices [Big Tech</a></h2>

                <p>Lots and lots of Android programming. There was a ton of cool stuff going on though. Big takeaway: do NOT take your formal database education for granted!</p>
