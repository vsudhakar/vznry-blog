## Experience

### RISE Research Scholar

**Theory of Distributed Systems, University of Paderborn (Germany)**

*May 2017 - Aug 2017*

I worked as a research assistant for the summer through the DAAD RISE scholarship program. My work concentrated on developing distributed routing approaches in hybrid networks with holes. My time was evenly split between researching and developing theory based approaches, and implementing network visualization tools for various topologies.

### Reese News Lab Fellowship

**360 Life Stream, UNC School of Media and Journalism, Chapel Hill**

*Aug 2016 - Jan 2017*

As a part of the Reese News Lab fellowship, I worked on the 360 Life Stream project designed to live stream and archive footage from police arrests using cameras mounted on squad cars. My work focused on developing live video stitching software, optimized for the NVIDIA Jetson platform. I also worked with multi platform video encoding, and low latency video delivery from vehicles to fleet managers. This project involved extensive work using C++, Python, OpenCV, and the NVIDIA CUDA library.

### Research Assistant

**Zavlanos Lab, Duke University, Durham**

*Nov 2015 - May 2017*

As a research assistant in the Zavlanos lab, I developed and built aerial SLAM platforms using quadcopters and off-the-shelf RGBD sensors for mapping and motion planning research.

**Research Assistant and Web Developer**

*UNC Department of Economics, Chapel Hill*

I led complete overhaul of the Airports Council International - North America facilities survey site as a part of a research group at UNC Chapel Hill. Project work included migrating 5 years of preexisting records from fragmented SQL tables into an adaptable, document based database, developing a RESTful backend for the survey, as well as designing both a responsive frontend questionnaire and an admin interface to view, analyze, and export historical survey data.
